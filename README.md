# My Projects

Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find a showcase of my skills and projects in various programming languages and data science domains. Feel free to explore the GitHub repositories linked below.

## Data Science Projects

### Python
- **[Shiny on EC2](https://github.com/swordman08/shiny-app)**: Interactive R Shiny California Real Estate AVM that was deployed on Amazon EC2. Modeling done in Python, models cached in PKL files for Shiny App.
- **[Housing Valuation](https://github.com/swordman08/HousingCA)**: Housing Valuation Model for California Real Estate with XGBoost. 4 additional variables were added to the final model with Google Places API and walkscore API, improving upon the earlier model by increasing test R-Squared by 27.1% and decreasing test RMSE by 33%.

### R
- **[IMDB Movies](https://github.com/swordman08/R-Code-Problem-4)**: Examining what variables affect the Gross Profit of a movie the most with machine learning ensemble models Random Forest and Tree.

### SQL
- **[Animal Adoption](https://github.com/swordman08/Pet-Adoption)**: A mock pet adoption Flask based HTML website that allows for a range of user interactions that directly manipulate a MySQL database with the help of a Python application.
- **[Ride Share](https://github.com/swordman08/RideShare)**: Driver and Passenger can login to portal to find rides. MySQL database stores all the information needed about passengers and drivers, such as Ratings, Car type, Liscense plate ID, number, etc...

### C++
- **[Student Faculty Database](https://github.com/swordman08/lazyBST)**: A student faculty database that allows for manipulation of records, implemented with a lazy binary search tree (LBST) from scratch.
- **[Grid Mario](https://github.com/swordman08/Mario)**: 2D grid based mario simulation that keeps making moves until death or win. User inputs starting features such as lives, levels, grid size per level, monsters per level, etc...
